# Netflix-Movies-TV-shows-Data-Analytics-Project

## Data Cleansing and Preparation
In this project, I worked with a Netflix dataset and performed data cleansing and preparation using MySQL and MS Excel. The raw dataset was in a variety of formats and needed to be transformed and cleaned before it could be used for analysis.

### Data Cleansing

#### Raw dataset files for MySQL Data Cleansing:

* Raw_data-netflix Workbook (xlsx format)
* netflix_titles-Sheet1 (csv format)
* netflix_titles_cast-Sheet2 (csv format)
* netflix_titles_category-Sheet3 (csv format)
* netflix_titles_countries-Sheet4 (csv format)
* netflix_titles_directors-Sheet5 (csv format)

#### We used MySQL to perform this transformation, which includes:

> Merging datasets together using joins

#### MySQL code performed for Data Cleansing:

* sql_Curated_data-netflix (sql format)

#### Cleaned dataset generated after performing MySQL Data Cleansing:

* Curated_data-netflix (csv format) stored into Curated_data-netflix (zip format)

### Data Preparation

#### Dataset for Data Preparation:

* Curated_data-netflix (csv format)

#### We also used Excel to perform additional data preparation tasks, such as:

> Power queries to remove null and duplicate values

> Standardizing data formats (e.g. converting dates into a consistent format)

#### Final dataset generated after performing Excel Data Preparation:

* Curated_data-netflix-Final (xlsx format)

## Data Visualization

#### Dataset for Data Visualization:

* Curated_data-netflix-Final (xlsx format)

Once the data was cleansed and prepared, we used Tableau to create a variety of visualizations to explore and understand the Netflix dataset. This included:

> Bar charts to show trends in movies & TV shows relases over time

> Bar charts to compare different categories of movies and TV shows (e.g. genre, ratings)

> Map plot to identify relationships between variables (e.g. countries and number of movies & TV shows)

The visualizations allowed us to identify patterns and trends in the Netflix dataset, and to communicate our findings to stakeholders.

#### Data Visualization Workbook:

* Netflix-Data Viz. with Tableau (ppt format)
* Netflix-Data Viz. with Tableau (twbx format)

* Netflix-Data Viz. with Tableau Dashboard on Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vipul.soni/viz/Netflix-DataViz_withTableau/Netflix 

Overall, this project demonstrated the importance of thoroughly cleansing and preparing data before performing analysis, and the power of data visualization in understanding and communicating insights.
